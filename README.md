# movie-ticket-booking-bot

The Movie Ticket Booking Bot is a script designed to streamline the process of reserving movie tickets from QFX Cinemas' website in Nepal. Users input essential details like the movie name, showtime, and cinema location, and the bot takes care of booking or reserving the seats for that specific movie at the designated time and cinema by opening a automated browser tab. Furthermore, the bot can also monitor ticket availability on the website and secure seats as soon as they become available for booking, ensuring users don't miss out on their preferred shows.  
The bot is coded in Python, using the Selenium library for its functionality. This bot was created as a fun side project while I was learning about web scraping and browser automation. Its purpose is solely for learning and enjoyment, and it is not intended for any harmful or malicious use.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required packages from the requirements.txt.



## Usage

Just run the qfx.py script.

## Note
Unfortunately, the bot no longer functions as intended because the QFX Cinemas website has undergone a recent revamp, which may have affected the bot's ability to interact with the site's new structure.
